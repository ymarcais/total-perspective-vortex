  # Total-Perspective-Vortex
  This subject aims to create a brain computer interface based on electroencephalographic data (EEG data) with the help of machine learning algorithms. Using a subject’s EEG reading, it infers what he or she is thinking about or doing - (motion) A or B in a t0 to tn timeframe. The data was mesured during a motor imagery experiment, where people had to do or imagine a hand or feet movement.
